# 2nd Webpack exploration project

1. Setup webpack from scratch
2. Configure Babel and React
3. Code splitting using webpack.config.js
4. use CommonsChunkPluginExclude to put dependencies vendor.js instead of bundle.js
5. Add cache busting to output files
6. Add rifraf to the build for project clean-up

The react project is taken from [StephenGrider](https://github.com/StephenGrider/WebpackProject) to work of a base and improve the build process and load speed.
